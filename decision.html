<h2>Decision</h2>

So I moved to New York last year in 2022. Before coming here, my friends underscored that I should live in Manhattan
and not Jersey City. I certainly wanted (still do?) to live in Manhattan but housing in Manhattan is
a beast. 

<p>
For starters, you cannot (or rather shouldn't) get an apartment sight unseen. If you do, there'
a high probability you will be in pain. Thanks Reddit for giving me that insight. So, I decided 
to get a sublease. Getting a sublease sight unseen is the same problem but bigger. Now you have to
deal with the apartment as well as people. So, I got a sublease in guess what Jersey City because
lots of Indians in Jersey City and I know my tribe. 

<p>
That was great. Next task, find an apartment. This is where decision paralysis comes into play.
You got so many neighborhoods to pick from. Then there's the entire broker saga. You gotta pay 15% of
your annual rent, which is like $4000-$5000.
